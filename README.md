# Capstone Project
Details of the project are in the Jupyter Notebook along with data sources, steps followed etc. 

*However, here is a brief overview...*

I pulled bicycle hire data & accident data from TFL using their API, downloaded bicycle census, crime, and UK address data from multiple sources. I read in, cleaned, ran data quality checks and stored this data in a cassandra database. I chose a noSQL database as its highly scalable with a high-performance distrubted design. I also defined and created a data dictionary to assist analyst. 

Near the bottom of the notebook, I have listed out future developmet to future proof the solution if and most likely when data volumes increase.
